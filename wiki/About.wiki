My former colleagues, great people from [http://www.cosylab.com Cosylab], asked me for help in setting up Guice, Hibernate and GWT. As a side effect I am publishing parts of the code here.

It is fully functional MVP style web-app using Guice and Hibernate.

I'd like to give some words of advice in the wiki pages for each library used. The stuff that has bitten me so it doesn't bite you.
