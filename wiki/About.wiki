#summary What guicymorphic is about

Basically some colleagues asked me if I can show them how to use Guice in an web application with mvp style gwt code. As a side effect I am publishing my effort thus far for everybody to see.

It is fully functional MVP style web-app using Guice and Hibernate.

I'd like to give some words of advice in the wiki pages for each library used. The stuff that has bitten me so it doesn't bite you.
